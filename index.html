                <section itemprop="articleBody"><h1>Finally getting the hang of working with Pelican!</h1>
<p>If you've seen my <a href="https://github.com/clamytoe/clamytoe.github.io">source repo</a> for this site, you know that I followed <a href="https://opensource.com/users/jnyjny">Erik O'Shaughnessy's</a> <em>Run your blog on GitHub Pages with Python</em> <a href="(https://opensource.com/article/19/5/run-your-blog-github-pages-python)">tutorial</a>.
It's a great tutorial, I specifically love his <strong>one weird trick</strong>, but it leaves so many unanswered questions.
Go read it now if you haven't and we'll pick up where he leaves off.</p>
<p>Luckily he does provide the link to the official <a href="https://docs.getpelican.com/">documentation</a>.
It was through that link that I found Pelican's tutorials <a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican/wiki/Tutorials">repo</a>.
Specifically <a href="https://www.fullstackpython.com/about-author.html">Matt Makai's</a> introductory <a href="https://www.fullstackpython.com/blog/generating-static-websites-pelican-jinja2-markdown.html">tutorial</a>.
I'll admit, that I only skimmed over it, it's kind of long.
I was looking for anything that would jump out at me.
What caught my eye was how simple it all was to automate things with <code>make</code>!</p>
<p>I took a quick look at mine and saw what commands were defined.</p>

</code></pre></div>


<p>Looking at the <code>Makefile</code> source is where I noticed that for local development, it just uses the <code>pelicanconf.py</code> script, but for publishing it uses <code>publishconf.py</code>.
Looking at <code>publishconf.py</code> I saw that it actually imports <code>pelicanconf.py</code> and then overrides some of the variables.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>AHA!</strong> This is were I had a eurika moment!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had noticed a problem with my site.
Whenever I clicked on the header link, instead of taking me back to the home page it would just reload whatever page I was on.
I was able to get around that by just specifying the <code>SITE_URL</code> variable in <code>pelicanconf.py</code>.
Unfortunately, that broke testing the blog locally because all the links would point to the live site on GitHub!</p>
<p>What I'm trying to say here is that in I was able to resolve both of these issues by making the following changes.</p>
<p><code>pelicanconf.py</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">SITEURL</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p><code>publishconf.py</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">SITEURL</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;https://clamytoe.github.io&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>Another issue that I was having was that I couldn't figure out how to get my <code>favicon.ico</code> to be treated as a static file and automatically dumped into the <code>output</code> directory.
My solution had been to write a little bash script to copy it over for me, but that was kind of tedious.
But now that I was going to use the <code>Makefile</code> I decided to automate it in there!</p>
<p>I added the following lines to it:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nv">FAVICON</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">$(</span>INPUTDIR<span class="k">)</span>/static/favicon.ico
</code></pre></div>


<p>Then after the <code>html</code>, <code>regenerate</code>, and <code>publish</code> commands, I added:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="err">cp</span> <span class="k">$(</span><span class="nv">FAVICON</span><span class="k">)</span> <span class="k">$(</span><span class="nv">OUTPUTDIR</span><span class="k">)</span>
</code></pre></div>


<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: I had initially added that to all of the commands, but the ones that run the server, don't actually get to that step.
When I <em>Ctrl+C</em> out of it, it just exists...</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>New workflow</h2>
<p>With that all set, things are now much easier and make more sense.
What I would recommend, is to run the <code>make clean</code> command and commit it to your <code>content</code> branch.
Now you will have a <em>clean</em> slate to start with.</p>
<p>You can now add any new content and do the following commands:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>git add .
git commit -m <span class="s2">&quot;Your description...&quot;</span>
git push origin content
</code></pre></div>


<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: Of course, only push your files when you're ready to, but you get the idea.
Now you're ready to generate the actual site, here's how that's now done.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Generate the site</h3>
<p>If you just want to generate the site this is the command that you want:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>make html
</code></pre></div>


<p>Then you can either run the Pelican server or the Python one.</p>
<h4>Pelican server</h4>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>pelican --listen
</code></pre></div>


<h4>Python server</h4>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nb">cd</span> output
python -m http.server
</code></pre></div>


<p>Both of those will make the site accessible at <code>http://localhost:8000</code></p>
<h3>Generate site and preview</h3>
<p>Now, if you know that you will be wanting to preview your site, a much better way is to use this command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>make devserver
</code></pre></div>


<p>Not only will this generate the site, but will also start the Pelican server automagically for you!
This option comes in handy when you are tweaking your site's theme.
I wanted to change the colors on mine and doing it like this automatically detected the changes and served them up.</p>
<h3>Publish the site</h3>
<p>This command generates the site using the <code>publishconf.py</code> script, so if you specified your site's url in there, it will add it to the generated html pages.
It's nice for making sure all is working correctly and enabling your Google Analytics; if you're into that sort of thing.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>make publish
</code></pre></div>


<h3>Publish and push to github</h3>
<p>Now, we're cooking with Crisco!
This command will generate the final site using <code>publishconf.py</code>, merge the output into your <code>master</code> branch, and push it up the hubs; all in one step!</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>make github
</code></pre></div>


<h3>Cleaning up</h3>
<p>Now that you've pushed to the hubs, removed the generated files:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>make clean
</code></pre></div>


<p>If you run <code>git status</code>, you should see that there are no changes and that you are ready to add more content.
Nice!</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This was a great learning experience for me.
Not only did I update the color scheme of my site, I also fixed some annoying issues that I was having.
Now I don't have to look up any <code>ghp-import ...</code> command and things just got a heck of a lot more pleasant.</p>
<p><strong>In summary</strong>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>touch content/posts/new-blog-post.md
vi <span class="nv">$_</span>
<span class="c1"># write the blog content</span>
git status
git add .
git commit -m <span class="s2">&quot;New blog post.&quot;</span>
git push origin content
make github
make clean
</code></pre></div>


<h3>On a side note...</h3>
<p>I was also having a weird problem with my search feature.
I had to remove the machine code from my <a href="https://clamytoe.github.io/category/cryptography.html">cryptography</a> blog post because it was completely screwing up the JavaScript.
Once I got that working, I then noticed that whenever I tried to do a search from any of the category pages, that it was looking for <code>/category/search.html</code>.
That page doesn't exists, so I was baffled as to why that was going on.
I took a look at the <a href="https://github.com/lucachr/pelican-mg">pelican-mg</a> theme's <a href="https://palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/">Jinja</a> templates and found the issue in <code>base.html</code>.
I simply had to add <code>{{ SITEURL }}</code> in the <code>action</code> part of the form:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">form</span> <span class="na">class</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;uk-search&quot;</span> <span class="na">action</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;{{ SITEURL }}/search.html&quot;</span> <span class="na">data-uk-search</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>Now it works beautifully!</p>
<p>Of course, with me being an upstanding netcitizen, I submitted a <a href="https://github.com/lucachr/pelican-mg/pull/11">pull request</a> to fix the issue :).</p></section>
